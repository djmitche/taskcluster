# Object Service

The object service provides storage for large blobs of data.

## Backends

This service supports pluggable backends, as defined in the service configuration.
Each backend has its own configuration and specifies a backend type, which corresponds to an implementation in `src/backends`.

Each object is assigned a backend when it is created.

The base class for backends, in `src/backends/base.js`, is authoritative for the methods and behaviors that a backend must display.

## Development

No special configuration is required for development.

Run `yarn workspace taskcluster-object test` to run the tess.
Some of the tests will be skipped without additional credentials, but it is fine to make a pull request as long as no tests fail.
The required setup for those credentials is in `test/helper/<backendType>.js` for each backend.
The tests' use of cloud resources is minimal and should be within the free tier or otherwise very cheap, if you would like to set it up yourself.
